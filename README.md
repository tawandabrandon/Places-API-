#aka Cold Calling Scrapper
Used this to find details of businesses in Cape Town streets, given coordinates the script would write Business information to 
an Excel file (CSV). We would then use the information collected for Cold Calling.

The program was written in Java utilizing the Google Places API. It takes 2 string arguments; Coordinates and Radius (in metres) then
it will crawl the area picking up all businesses registered within the area, collecting: Business Name, Address, Email, Phone number,
Business Type and Ratings.
